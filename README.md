# RokokoSmartsuitProII

These scripts were developed to analyze gait data recorded with the Rokoko Smartsuit Pro II.
The Rokoko Studio software outputs .fbx files from each recording session, which can then be imported into Unity for further analysis using these scripts.

This work was conducted as part of the research project “Applying Eye-based Measures for Cognition-Aware Systems (EyeCog)”, where the Rokoko Smartsuit Pro II served as one of the primary apparatus used for data collection and analysis.
